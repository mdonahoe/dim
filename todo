[ ] yank line yy and paste it with p almost works, but if the yank is a full line, it should paste a new line, rather than pasting at the current character
[x] yank a word with yw
[ ] capital A should take me to the end of the line and enter insert mode, not the character before the end
[ ] capital C should delete until the end of the line and enter insert mode,
[ ] r should replace the current character with the next character and remain in normal mode.
[ ] capital F should be like lowercase f, but searching backward. ditto capital T
[ ] sometimes I get stuck in INSERT mode and ESCAPE does nothing. What is happening?
[ ] :q should warn before quitting if there are changes to the file, of if the current buffer is unsaved and didnt start with a file
