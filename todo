[ ] capital A should take me to the end of the line and enter insert mode, not the character before the end
[ ] :q should warn before quitting if there are changes to the file, of if the current buffer is unsaved and didnt start with a file
[ ] status bar should tell me when im in VISUAL mode.
[ ] improve the highlighting for visual mode so it appears on crappy terminals with limited colors
[ ] pasting a yanked line should create a new line below the cursor, and not interfere with the current position. the current implemnentation will split the line the cursor is one when adding a new line. i dont like that.
[ ] sometimes I get stuck in INSERT mode and ESCAPE does nothing. What is happening?
